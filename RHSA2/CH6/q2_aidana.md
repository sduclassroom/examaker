When you run this 'getfacl file' ACL operation there will be output like this 'mask::rw-'. What exactly mask settings do?

* `identify the directory name,owner and group-owner`
* `display ACL settings on a file`
+ `show the maximum permissions possible for all named users,the group-owner and named-groups`
* `show the initial maximum permissions possible for all new files or directories created that have named user ACLs`
